what is ethereum? 
-its a cryptocurrency with a price 
- can be bought and sold 
- send and received 
- held in a wallet 

It is a general purpose blockchain platform 
it is a peer to peer network of nodes required to talk to each other 
we connect to a node by ourselves or with a url 
node will talk for us in the network 

Proof of Work 
- nodes in the network compete to solve crypto puzzles, 
the first to solve it will put it on the blockchain and get rewarded 
this is a consensus algorithm 
each transaction requires a small fee in order to let the transaction happen, 
we submit transaction to network, then miners solve puzzle that network creates, each guess 
gets compared to the original solution. first miner that has similar guess to the original solution it will 
get rewared the ether 


Proof of stake 
will be added later




Security!
How are transactions secure?
51% attack rule, 
in order to change or tamper with the balance, we would need to change or tamper the transaction 
in the ledger that was put in the past. It would take a lot of computing power to recompute the original block we want take
to change and then recompute every block after. 

We would need to control 51% of the computation power to change the block we want. 


Gas Fee 
we need to pay gas fee everytime we create new transaction on the network 
since we put the transaction on the network we need to insentivize them to mine it.
